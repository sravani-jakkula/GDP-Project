# PROJECT
### My Idea

#### Get Farmer Application

My idea is simple and useble. 
It is gonna be use customers and farmers. Now-a-days **farmer** is the only person who ***losses*** everything what they have.
So, I am going to create web application for **_farmers and customers_**. By using this application customers gonna get everything what they want from farmers. 
So if we use this app customers get with low prize and organic things and avoid of buyers and avoid risk factors.


we have couple ideas and eventually we finalized ***Inventory maintanance*** 


Project All about the inventory maintanance , it means helps companies identify which and ***how much stock*** to order at what time
The practice identifies and responds to trends to ensure there's always enough stock to fulfill customer orders and proper warning of a shortage



My role is all about Database.
Database is nothing but An organized collection of structured information, The database management system is usually responsible for managing databases.
In a database, information is organized, managed, and updated easily. A computer database is a repository for storing aggregated data, such as sales transactions, customer data, financial information, and product information, in a database.

Use of **Database** is nothing but Information itself can be stored in a variety of ways; before digital computers, card files, printed books, and other methods were used, information was stored in paper.


our next step is, based on our project i am gonna do the data base. so my team members, every body do your own roles and responsibiities and we gonna do project that we can implement idea and we gonna find our own requirements and we will rock.
